<h1 align="center"> üèÉ Social Media API üìù</h1>
<h2 align="center"> RESTful API with a MongoDB Database. <i> Version 1.0.0 </i> </h2>
<p><strong>Quick and READ ME!</strong> is an easy-to-use, command-line interface that helps a user to quickly create a professional README markdown file. Created in <em>Node.js</em> with the <em>Inquirer npm package</em>, it can be run on a local machine from the command line. It will invite a user to answer a series of question prompts about their current project, and generate a simple README file based on their input. The user is then free to copy across to their own project's repository. </p>

This is the back-end API for a social media application. The API can create users, have them create friend relationships, add thoughts, add react to thoughts

## About
### Project History
Project built for bootcamp - history of bootcamp - context in the course (which 'module', which week). What I learned from it, enjoyed and didn't enjoy. Include a link to the project brief here (and was there starter code?).

### Demonstration Video
The video demonstration of this application is in three parts:  
Part one: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KoKWxCmrjT_RMXjkNRKYJiCmpLon5udW/view  
Part two: https://drive.google.com/file/d/12uSwk7OFd6T0tNGlnw8bBDfC2XRcDVKI/view  
Part three: https://drive.google.com/file/d/15xeSD2VhDvq49BxCWRFx7zyh3ukT69S4/view  

### Live Deployment
Was this on heroku? I'm not sure. 

## Key Features
### Key Feature A
Want to include: demonstration of all CRUD operations; subdocuments; mongoose for modellings; aggregates, virtuals, cursor methods, instances i fI use any of those features; mongodb and mongodb atlas. Express understanding probably key here. Validator. 
Routing with Express -> CRUD Operations with MongoDB (Atlas?) -> Working with Subdocuments -> Object-Relational M[apping] with Mongoose -> Validator
## Installation
### Prerequisities
Probably just npm / node for this one - but also MongoDB Compass and Postman for testing (and storing database locally?)
### Cloning the Repository
Probably gonna be quite standard  here - maybe could include link to github, walk through how I do it - or zip/unzip.
### Running the Project Locally
npm run start - and what else?
## Usage
### Key Usage A
Talk through all operations - ie: every document type, how to make/delete/etc - with an API request.
Users -> Thoughts -> Comments -> Friends (?)
## Testing
Testing in Postman / Insomnia, demonstration. Compass.
## Version History
### Version 1.1.0
README improved
### Version 1.0.0
Bootcamp version - re-explain, record feedback. 
## License
Currently is MIT and did have a badge - but want to check and possibly change this if time!
## Contribution
### Contribution Guidelines
Contact me - lock repo - look at the open issues as that is the next feature I want to work on.
### Future Development
Unique branding and a front-end - boring project at the moment! Rainbow themed? Or attach it to a blog (can also link to React blog once that has been built. 
## Questions
