<h2 align="center"> RESTful API with a MongoDB Database. <i> Version 1.0.0 </i> </h2>
<p><strong>Quick and READ ME!</strong> is an easy-to-use, command-line interface that helps a user to quickly create a professional README markdown file. Created in <em>Node.js</em> with the <em>Inquirer npm package</em>, it can be run on a local machine from the command line. It will invite a user to answer a series of question prompts about their current project, and generate a simple README file based on their input. The user is then free to copy across to their own project's repository. </p>

This is the back-end API for a social media application. The API can create users, have them create friend relationships, add thoughts, add react to thoughts
