* NOTE: Slight error in part one; I said in my intro that the API queries were built with GraphQL, but this is a RESTFUL API application.  

## Description
This is the back-end API for a social media application. The API can create users, have them create friend relationships, add thoughts, add react to thoughts. The database is MongoDB and the querying is done with GraphQL.
